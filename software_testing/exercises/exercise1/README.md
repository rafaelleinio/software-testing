## Exercise 1

Using an automated testing framework (it can be in your preferred programming language; JUnit, jest, etc.), create some test cases for a triangle classification application.

Create a Triangle class with three attributes representing the sides of a triangle. The class must have a method that classifies the triangle. Create tests for this classification method.

If you want to do procedural or functional, feel free. It is enough that the tests are implemented correctly.

Don't forget to test to see if the triangle is valid.
